# Phase Status

| Phase | Status | Branch/Commit | Tests | Deliverables | Known gaps | Next |
|---:|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 — Discovery/specification | **Complete** | `main`; preserved history | 507 current regression checks; 13 Mermaid renders; schemas/YAML/structure passed | Full documentation, schemas, examples, diagrams, governance, and responsibility scaffolds | No runtime artifacts by design; implementation evidence belongs to later phases | Preserved |
| 1 — Engineering foundation | **Complete and approved** | `main`; Phase 1 baseline preserved | 38/38 passed at Phase 1 exit | .NET solution, typed foundations, configuration/DI, privacy logging, SQLite migration base, detection-only validation, restricted CLI, WinUI shell, CI and inventories | Installer, execution, elevation, service, and helper remain absent | Preserved |
| 2 — Read-only scanner | **Complete and approved** | main; Phase 2 baseline preserved | 77/77 passed at Phase 2 exit; WinUI Automation passed | Fixed NTFS discovery, bounded Quick/Deep metadata scanner, cancellation/partial coverage, top-N/extension aggregates, CLI/WinUI, privacy-safe JSON/schema, CI/verifier | Logical size only; hard links may double-count; allocated size and persistence deferred | Preserved |
| 3 — Rules/explanations | **Complete and approved** | `main`; Phase 3 baseline preserved | 94/94 passed at Phase 3 exit | Streaming classifier, 36 verified built-ins, deterministic ownership, explanations, CLI/WinUI, report v2, CI/verifier | Logical estimates; exact known-folder identity and allocated/hard-link accounting remain limited | Preserved |
| 4 — Snapshots/growth | **Implemented — awaiting approval** | Current working tree; no Git mutations by instruction | 114/114 passed; Phase 0–4 verifier green | Versioned aggregate SQLite history, HMAC drive identity, retention/deletion, deterministic comparisons, CLI/WinUI, schemas/ADR | Logical estimates; USN deliberately unsupported; cloned volume identity remains documented | Stop; await approval for Phase 5 |
| 5 — Dry-run planning | Planned | — | Not run | Immutable fake-fixture plans | No implementation | After Phase 4 approval |
| 6 — Low-risk execution | Planned | — | Not run | Tiny allowlist and helper | Security questions open; no implementation | After Phase 5 approval |
| 7 — Developer Mode | Planned | — | Not run | First-party tool adapters | No implementation | After Phase 6 approval |
| 8 — Move workflows | Planned | — | Not run | Supported migrations | No implementation | After Phase 7 approval |
| 9 — Public beta | Planned | — | Not run | Hardening/signing/MSIX/SBOM | No release identity/artifacts | After Phase 8 approval |
| 10 — Ecosystem/v1 | Planned | — | Not run | Safe rule community and v1 | No implementation | After Phase 9 approval |

## Current working-tree evidence

- Working tree: Phase 4 implementation over the approved Phase 3 baseline; no Git mutation was performed by Codex.
- SDK/runtime: .NET SDK 10.0.301, MSBuild 18.6.4, .NET runtime 10.0.9, Windows 10.0.26200 x64.
- Stable UI toolchain: Windows App SDK 2.2.0, WinUI 2.2.1, Windows SDK Build Tools 10.0.28000.2270, `net10.0-windows10.0.26100.0`, `win-x64`.
- Persistence: schema-v2 aggregate snapshot history on Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.Core 10.0.9 plus SQLitePCLRaw.bundle_e_sqlite3 3.0.3; SourceGear.sqlite3 3.50.4.5; runtime SQLite 3.50.4.
- Verification: Phase 0–4 gates passed; warning-free Release solution/App builds; 114 tests across eight projects; offline 36-rule pack, privacy, migration, retention, comparison, drift, overflow, CLI, safety, Windows, and one-million-observation gates passed.
- Synthetic scanner evidence on this host: 10,000 entries in 28 ms, 100,000 in 285 ms, and 1,000,000 in 673 ms. Each retained exactly 25 top files and remained below the 256 MiB budget. These are fixture measurements, not universal device claims.
- Optional real-drive smoke: an explicit Quick C:\ scan ran metadata-only to process exit with no export/write destination. The last captured progressive observation before console detachment was 95,679 files, 29,963 directories, 51.45 GiB logical bytes, and 11,154 depth/coverage skips; this is not an exact whole-drive total.
- Security boundary: `asInvoker`; metadata-only scan and CLYR-owned aggregate database writes only. No content reads, hydration, reparse traversal, scanned-file mutation, cleanup, planning, movement, Recycle Bin operation, arbitrary process execution, elevation, service, startup registration, or functional helper.

Phase 0–3 history remains preserved. Phase 4 implementation completed locally on 2026-07-13 and is stopped at its approval gate. Phase 5 has not begun.
